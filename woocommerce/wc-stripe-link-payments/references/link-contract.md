## Object and identifier matrix

| Layer | Native Link | Card used through Link |
|---|---|---|
| Stripe PaymentMethod ID | `pm_...` | `pm_...` |
| Stripe `type` | `link` | `card` |
| Stripe details | `link.email` | `card.brand`, `last4`, expiry, fingerprint, `wallet.type=link` |
| Woo class | `WC_Payment_Token_Link` | `WC_Stripe_Payment_Token_CC` |
| Woo token type | `link` | `CC` |
| Woo gateway ID | `stripe` | `stripe` |
| Duplicate key | Link email | Stripe card fingerprint |
| Display | `Stripe Link (email)` | ordinary card display in 10.9.0 |

The local Link class extends base `WC_Payment_Token`, not `WC_Payment_Token_CC`. Its extra data contains only `email`. It has no card brand, last4, expiry, or fingerprint contract.

The plugin maps lowercase token type `link` explicitly through `woocommerce_payment_token_class`. Without the active Stripe plugin/classmap/filter, core would derive a different class name and cannot reliably hydrate this provider-specific token. Treat plugin availability as a runtime requirement.

### `payment_method_type` accessor caveat

The Link class defines `set_payment_method_type()` and `get_payment_method_type()`, and creation code calls the setter. However, `payment_method_type` is absent from the class's `extra_data`, while `WC_Data::set_prop()` ignores undeclared properties. Runtime verification on 10.9.0 therefore yields:

```text
get_type()                => "link"
get_payment_method_type() => null
```

Use `get_type()`. Treat the accessor as a version-specific upstream inconsistency, not a usable contract.

## Why Link is hidden behind the main gateway

`WC_Stripe_UPE_Payment_Method_Link::get_id()` returns the provider method type `link`. The helper sets itself reusable but returns false from `is_available()`. Link appears inside Stripe-owned UI:

- the standard Payment Element associated with the card/main gateway;
- the Express Checkout Element;
- Optimized Checkout's consolidated element.

The method helper exists so the main gateway can describe, validate, save, and title Link. Its `link` ID is not a Woo gateway registration, and no `stripe_link` payment gateway is registered. Consequently:

- token gateway: `stripe`;
- order/subscription gateway: `stripe`;
- standard saved-token input: `wc-stripe-payment-token`;
- title may be `Link`;
- `stripe_link` must not be used as a business discriminator.

Determine Link from the final Stripe PaymentMethod/Woo token or from the trusted order title/type metadata maintained by the gateway, depending on the task.

## Token construction and duplicate rules

The Link method's creation path stores:

```text
class       WC_Payment_Token_Link
type        link
gateway_id  stripe
token       Stripe pm_... ID
user_id     WordPress user ID
email       Stripe payment_method.link.email
```

Creation must follow a server-retrieved Stripe PaymentMethod. Do not build this tuple from customer POST data.

`WC_Stripe_Payment_Tokens::get_duplicate_token()` loads up to 100 local tokens for the customer/gateway and delegates comparison to each token. Link equality requires:

```text
payment_method.type == link
payment_method.link.email == token.email
```

It does not compare PaymentMethod IDs. During remote synchronization, if a matching email is found and the old local `pm_...` is absent from the returned remote IDs, the local row is updated to the new PaymentMethod ID. This makes the email a reconciliation key, not an authorization key or globally unique domain identity.

## Remote reconciliation

`WC_Stripe_Payment_Tokens` filters `woocommerce_get_customer_payment_tokens`. On a logged-in request it can reconcile the local token list with the Stripe Customer:

1. accept only reusable Stripe gateway IDs;
2. stop when the initial local token count reaches `posts_per_page`;
3. categorize stored and deprecated local tokens by provider ID;
4. fetch all remote Stripe Customer PaymentMethods, cached under an all-methods transient;
5. filter to active reusable types, or inspect all reusable types under Optimized Checkout;
6. preserve matching `pm_...` rows;
7. create missing type-specific Woo tokens;
8. collapse duplicates using the type-specific comparator;
9. delete local rows not represented in the active remote result, except that Optimized Checkout preserves remotely present rows for disabled or temporarily unavailable methods while excluding them from the returned list.

The cleanup temporarily removes the normal remote-detach deletion action. Thus local reconciliation cleanup does not detach the PaymentMethod from Stripe.

Practical consequences:

- `get_customer_tokens()` can perform network I/O and local writes;
- CLI/cron without a logged-in user sees local state only;
- transient state can delay remote changes until cleared by gateway operations/expiry;
- outside Optimized Checkout, disabled Link can be outside the active type set, so its local row can be removed and later recreated; under Optimized Checkout the remotely present row is preserved but hidden from the result;
- local token IDs are projections, not permanent external identifiers;
- repeated listing in a loop risks expensive provider synchronization.

Use `WC_Payment_Tokens::get_tokens()` with explicit arguments when the task intentionally needs raw local rows and must avoid the customer-token filter. Use the gateway's normal UI/service when reconciliation is desired; direct Stripe internal service calls require version pinning.

## Checkout and intent behavior

### Dedicated Link appearance settings in 10.9

Express Link now uses `link_button_locations` and `link_button_size`, separate from Apple Pay/Google Pay's `express_checkout_button_locations` and `express_checkout_button_size`. On upgrade, the migration initializes a missing Link location setting from the prior Express Checkout locations. The helper routes `get_button_locations( 'link' )` to the Link option and `get_link_button_height()` to Link's size.

Do not assume changing the generic Express Checkout appearance changes Link. If a version-pinned integration reads these internal helpers, test product, cart, checkout, and WCS change-payment locations. Stripe 10.9 also moved Express Checkout shipping and variable-product cart mutations to Woo Store API calls, so custom field/cart extensions must use Woo extension points rather than legacy Stripe AJAX interception.

### Standard Payment Element

The submitted Woo gateway remains `stripe`, so the selected internal type initially normalizes to `card`. When Link is enabled, intent creation expands that selection to:

```php
array( 'card', 'link' )
```

The final PaymentMethod object is authoritative. `set_payment_method_title_for_order()` detects `type=link`, forces order gateway `stripe`, and stores title `Link`.

The intent controller also treats a card selection as requiring Link mandate data when Link is enabled. A custom intent builder that strips `link` or bypasses the gateway's mandate handling is not equivalent.

### Express Checkout

The gateway intent request carries `express_payment_type=link`; the Express Checkout and WCS change-payment orchestration also uses `express_checkout_type=link`. For intent creation Link again permits both card and Link types. These markers express the UI route, not a promise that every returned provider object has identical shape.

### Save behavior

The gateway hides its own save checkbox for card/Link while Link is enabled because Stripe's Payment Element owns Link wallet consent. That does not guarantee a Woo token after every Link payment.

Woo token creation occurs when the gateway's merchant-side save path is active, including Add payment method SetupIntent, an automatic subscription requirement, an explicit supported save path, or later remote reconciliation of an attached PaymentMethod.

## Deletion and default behavior

Normal Woo token deletion invokes the Stripe token manager. For reusable Stripe gateways, including native Link, it detaches the stored `pm_...` from the Stripe Customer when provider-detach policy allows it. Do not detach manually and then delete the Woo token; that duplicates the remote operation.

Reconciliation cleanup intentionally disables that detach listener because a local stale/disabled projection should not necessarily delete the remote method.

Setting a Woo token as default triggers Stripe synchronization. Since Link token values begin with `pm_`, the plugin sets the Stripe Customer's default PaymentMethod. Keep the core ownership/nonce checks and normal token action rather than updating `is_default` or Stripe customer fields independently.

Deleting a local Link token does not delete the shopper's consumer Link account. It removes/detaches the merchant's Stripe Customer PaymentMethod relationship according to the gateway behavior.

## Orders and subscriptions

Orders store the main gateway `stripe` and title `Link`. Gateway-owned metadata stores the Stripe Customer and PaymentMethod/source ID. The PaymentMethod ID alone does not encode whether its object type is Link or card.

For WooCommerce Subscriptions:

- subscription gateway remains `stripe`;
- `_stripe_customer_id` identifies the Stripe Customer;
- `_stripe_source_id` can be a native Link or card-shaped `pm_...`;
- scheduled renewals use the normal `woocommerce_scheduled_subscription_payment_stripe` handler;
- display logic retrieves the provider object and renders `Via Stripe Link (email)` for native Link;
- payment-method changes must run WCS and Stripe orchestration, not raw meta updates.

Express change-payment has extra bookkeeping. It forces the old saved-token selector to `new`, clears implicit update-all consent, records the express type/payment-method ID across redirects, restores the `Link` title, and replaces the subscription's attached Woo token IDs through the order data store. Bypassing this can leave `_stripe_source_id`, `_payment_tokens`, visible title, and renewal behavior inconsistent.

## Security and compatibility

- Treat local token ID, provider `pm_...`, Link email, and Stripe Customer ID as separate identifiers.
- Verify local token ownership and gateway before use.
- Retrieve the provider object server-side when its actual type/customer matters.
- Do not authorize by Link email; it is PII and a mutable display/deduplication field.
- Do not expose raw provider IDs, customer IDs, client secrets, or full token objects through custom REST responses/logs.
- Avoid hard type hints to plugin classes before confirming Stripe is active and the class is loadable.
- Fail closed for unknown custom token types; do not cast them into a fake CC token.
- Pin and retest direct calls into Stripe gateway classes because they are extension internals.

## Regression checklist

- Hydrate `link` through the token-class filter and verify `get_type()`/`get_email()`.
- Verify `get_payment_method_type()` behavior against the installed plugin version.
- Verify native Link versus card wallet Link without calling the wrong getters.
- Exercise same-email duplicate and replacement-`pm_...` reconciliation.
- Compare logged-in customer listing with CLI/raw-local enumeration.
- Toggle Link off/on and observe local projection/recreated token ID.
- Test normal delete, reconciliation cleanup, and default selection separately.
- Test Payment Element and Express Checkout across classic, Blocks, and Optimized Checkout.
- Test one-time, Add payment method, subscription signup, renewal, change-payment, update-all, and 3DS return.
- Disable the Stripe plugin and verify custom code handles unhydratable provider-specific tokens safely.
