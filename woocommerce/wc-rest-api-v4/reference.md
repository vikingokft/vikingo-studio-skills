# WooCommerce REST API v4 reference

Source-verified against WooCommerce 11.0.0. These are latent core controller routes: the 11.0.0 release build disables `rest-api-v4`, so they are absent unless the build feature is altered. Methods can be narrowed by permissions; use exact runtime route discovery and authenticated `OPTIONS` when available.

## Deliberate absences

These common v3 surfaces are not v4 routes in WooCommerce 11.0.0:

- Product categories/tags/attributes and product variations.
- Coupons, taxes, shipping classes, reports, and system status.
- A payment-gateway settings collection route.
- Nested order notes/refunds/fulfillments under `/orders/<id>`.

Use `wc/v3` where it owns the resource.

## Hook prefix examples

The controller transforms hyphens, but not slashes:

```text
orders
woocommerce_rest_api_v4_orders_

shipping-zone-method
woocommerce_rest_api_v4_shipping_zone_method_

settings/emails
woocommerce_rest_api_v4_settings/emails_

settings/payment-gateways
woocommerce_rest_api_v4_settings/payment_gateways_
```

Append `collection_params`, `item_schema`, or `item_response` only when the concrete controller passes through the matching abstract method.

## Cache status

The v4 products controller wraps `get_suggested_products()` with `RestApiCache::with_cache()`. The feature can emit Woo cache status headers when enabled, but no code should assume a particular header or cache backend is present. Other v4 controllers in 11.0.0 do not call `with_cache()`.
