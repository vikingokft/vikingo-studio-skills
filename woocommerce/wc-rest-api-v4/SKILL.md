description: Audit WooCommerce's source-gated `wc/v4` REST API. In WooCommerce 11.0.0 the core v4 controllers exist but the release build still sets `rest-api-v4` false, so core routes are not registered by default. Covers runtime discovery, safe v3 fallback, latent routes including refund preview, settings paths, hook prefixes, authentication, fulfillments, and internal caching. Use when code targets `/wc/v4` or assumes source files mean a live public API.

# WooCommerce REST API v4

WooCommerce contains an authenticated merchant/integration API implementation under `wc/v4`. It is not the shopper-facing Store API and, in the 11.0.0 release build, it is not a generally available core API.

## Release gate in 11.0.0

Core registers its v4 controllers only when both conditions pass:

```php
wc_rest_should_load_namespace( 'wc/v4' )
Automattic\WooCommerce\Admin\Features\Features::is_enabled( 'rest-api-v4' )
```

`includes/react-admin/feature-config.php` sets `rest-api-v4` to `false` in WooCommerce 11.0.0. On a normal release install, core customers/orders/products/settings/fulfillment/refund-preview v4 routes are therefore absent even though their controller source files ship.

Other extensions can independently register routes under `/wc/v4`; seeing that namespace in the REST index does not prove WooCommerce core v4 is enabled. Check each exact route.

Do not force the build feature on with `woocommerce_admin_get_feature_config` in a production extension. The controller namespace is `Internal`, the surface can change, and consumers need a stable v3 fallback.

## Version selection

- Use v4 only after exact runtime route discovery on the target store and only when the integration accepts its source-gated status.
- Keep using v3 for resources absent from v4, including product categories and nested product variations.
- `wc/v3` is not deprecated. Migrate endpoint by endpoint, not by global search/replace.
- Discover schemas and methods with authenticated `OPTIONS /wp-json/wc/v4/<route>` against the deployed store.

The complete latent WooCommerce-core 11.0.0 route catalog is in [reference.md](reference.md). It describes controller source, not routes guaranteed to be registered by the release build.

Runtime discovery must run after route registration:

```php
add_action( 'rest_api_init', static function ( WP_REST_Server $server ): void {
    $routes        = $server->get_routes();
    $has_v4_orders = isset( $routes['/wc/v4/orders'] );
    // Store/use the result for diagnostics; do not register a competing route.
}, 20 );
```

For external clients, inspect the REST index/`OPTIONS` response and fail over to a supported v3 route rather than probing by causing a write.

## Important route shapes

Order child resources are flat:

```text
/wc/v4/order-notes?order_id=123
/wc/v4/refunds?order_id=123
/wc/v4/fulfillments?order_id=123
```

They are not `/orders/123/notes`, `/orders/123/refunds`, or `/orders/123/fulfillments`.

Shipping-zone methods use an instance ID:

```text
POST   /wc/v4/shipping-zone-method
GET    /wc/v4/shipping-zone-method/17
PUT    /wc/v4/shipping-zone-method/17
DELETE /wc/v4/shipping-zone-method/17
```

Payment gateway settings have only an item route:

```text
GET|PUT /wc/v4/settings/payment-gateways/<gateway-id>
GET     /wc/v4/settings/payments/offline-methods
```

Do not invent `/settings/payment-gateways` collection or `/settings/offline-payment-methods`; neither is registered in 11.0.0.

## WooCommerce 11.0 latent refund preview

WooCommerce 11.0 adds `POST /wc/v4/refunds/preview`. It calculates a preview and does not create a `WC_Order_Refund`, call the gateway, or restock items. Despite being read-only in effect, it deliberately uses the same create-refund permission check as refund creation so read-only API credentials cannot probe refundable order state.

Request shape:

```json
{
  "order_id": 123,
  "line_items": [
    { "line_item_id": 77, "quantity": 1 },
    { "line_item_id": 81, "refund_total": 12.50 }
  ]
}
```

Each line requires `line_item_id` and either a positive quantity or a non-zero tax-inclusive `refund_total` with the same sign as the original line. The response contains product/shipping/fee breakdowns plus `subtotal`, `tax`, `total`, and `max_refundable`, all as formatted decimal strings. Core rejects non-positive aggregate previews and totals above the order's remaining refundable amount.

The route remains behind the entire `rest-api-v4` build gate. Do not build a production extension that assumes this endpoint exists merely because WooCommerce 11.0 source contains it; discover the exact route and retain a supported fallback.

V4 also exposes the legacy-compatible generic setting-option wrapper under `/settings/<group_id>`, `/settings/<group_id>/<id>`, and `/settings/<group_id>/batch`. It redirects the v3 settings option controller into the v4 namespace; do not confuse it with the newer dedicated settings controllers.

## Authentication and authorization

v4 uses the existing WordPress/Woo REST stack:

- Cookie authentication plus `X-WP-Nonce: <wp_create_nonce('wp_rest')>` for same-origin logged-in browser code.
- WooCommerce consumer key/secret with HTTPS Basic Auth for server integrations.
- WordPress Application Passwords where appropriate.
- WooCommerce OAuth 1.0a where legacy integration requirements demand it.

Authentication does not imply object ownership. A custom customer-facing route must derive the user server-side and verify each order/token/resource belongs to that user. Never expose consumer secrets in browser code.

## Call from WordPress

```php
$request = new WP_REST_Request( 'GET', '/wc/v4/orders' );
$request->set_param( 'status', 'processing' );
$request->set_param( 'per_page', 25 );

$response = rest_do_request( $request );

if ( is_wp_error( $response ) || $response->is_error() ) {
    // Handle the REST error; do not assume get_data() is a collection.
    return;
}

$orders = $response->get_data();
```

An internal REST dispatch still runs route permission callbacks as the current WP user. It is not a capability bypass.

## Response filters and the slash trap

The abstract controller builds hooks as:

```php
'woocommerce_rest_api_v4_' . str_replace( '-', '_', $this->rest_base ) . '_'
```

It replaces hyphens only. Slashes remain in settings hook names.

| Route base | Item response filter |
|---|---|
| `customers` | `woocommerce_rest_api_v4_customers_item_response` |
| `order-notes` | `woocommerce_rest_api_v4_order_notes_item_response` |
| `settings/payment-gateways` | `woocommerce_rest_api_v4_settings/payment_gateways_item_response` |
| `settings/payments/offline-methods` | `woocommerce_rest_api_v4_settings/payments/offline_methods_item_response` |

This means a settings filter name can contain `/`. Do not normalize it to underscores unless the controller source does so.

Example:

```php
add_filter(
    'woocommerce_rest_api_v4_customers_item_response',
    static function ( WP_REST_Response $response, $customer, WP_REST_Request $request ): WP_REST_Response {
        if ( ! $customer instanceof WC_Customer ) {
            return $response;
        }

        $data                  = $response->get_data();
        $data['loyalty_tier']  = sanitize_key( $customer->get_meta( '_myplugin_loyalty_tier' ) );
        $response->set_data( $data );
        return $response;
    },
    10,
    3
);
```

The generated filter families are `<prefix>collection_params`, `<prefix>item_schema`, and `<prefix>item_response`, but bespoke subroutes can use other hooks. Read the concrete controller before depending on a hook.

## Internal classes are not extension bases

All v4 controllers are under `Automattic\WooCommerce\Internal`. Do not extend `V4\AbstractController`, import its traits, or instantiate controllers in plugin code. Register plugin routes with `WP_REST_Controller`, or filter the response of an existing route.

## Fulfillments have two gates

The whole core v4 namespace first needs `rest-api-v4`; fulfillment behavior additionally needs the `fulfillments` feature, which is disabled by default in 11.0.0. Route classes existing on disk does not guarantee a store exposes usable fulfillment behavior.

```php
use Automattic\WooCommerce\Utilities\FeaturesUtil;

if ( ! FeaturesUtil::feature_is_enabled( 'fulfillments' ) ) {
    return;
}
```

Do not silently force-enable a WooCommerce experimental feature from an extension.

## Product response capability boundary

V4 product responses can omit sensitive fields when the caller can read a published product but lacks product-management/private-read capabilities. Downloads, cost data, purchase notes, and raw metadata are not safe client contracts for under-privileged callers.

Treat field absence as an authorization-dependent schema outcome, not as empty product data.

## Order status behavior

`status=any` does not include `checkout-draft` in current v4 order queries. Request `status=checkout-draft` explicitly when auditing Store API draft orders.

The order item route also accepts action-style update parameters such as `payment_complete` and `reset_download_permissions`. Use these domain operations only with the required capability and idempotency controls; do not expose them through customer-owned proxy routes.

## REST cache: narrow, internal, and optional

`Automattic\WooCommerce\Internal\Traits\RestApiCache` is experimental and feature-gated by `rest_api_caching`. Backend caching also requires `woocommerce_rest_api_enable_backend_caching = yes`.

In the 11.0.0 v4 controllers, `with_cache()` is used for the `GET /products/suggested-products` callback, not as a blanket cache around all v4 resources. Do not promise cache hits for customers, orders, or arbitrary v4 routes.

The trait is internal; plugin routes should use stable WordPress cache APIs and explicit invalidation/versioning.

## Critical rules

- Never conflate `/wc/v4` with `/wc/store/v1`.
- Never treat shipped controller files or another plugin's `/wc/v4/*` route as proof that Woo core v4 is active.
- Never force-enable `rest-api-v4` from a production extension; use runtime discovery and v3 fallback.
- Never assume every v3 resource exists in v4.
- Never hardcode a hook prefix without checking `rest_base`, especially settings routes containing `/`.
- Never extend WooCommerce `Internal` REST classes.
- Never treat authenticated merchant REST responses as customer-safe payloads.
- Never assume fulfillments or REST backend caching are enabled.
- Never infer permissions from response shape; use explicit capabilities and ownership checks.
