# WooCommerce logging

Use WooCommerce's shared logger for operational diagnostics that merchants can inspect in WooCommerce Status logs. Logs are disposable observability data, never the only record that a payment, migration, export, or webhook completed.

## Basic pattern

```php
$logger = wc_get_logger();

$logger->info(
    'Order export queued.',
    array(
        'source'         => 'myplugin-export',
        'order_id'       => $order_id,
        'correlation_id' => $correlation_id,
        'attempt'        => $attempt,
    )
);
```

Always set a stable, plugin-prefixed `source`. Current file logging sanitizes it and expects at least three characters. Do not generate one source per order, user, request, or date; that fragments log browsing and creates excessive files/source records.

## Levels

| Level | Use |
|---|---|
| `debug` | Detailed development diagnostics; high volume and normally thresholded in production |
| `info` | Normal lifecycle milestones useful for operations |
| `notice` | Significant but expected condition |
| `warning` | Recoverable anomaly, fallback, retry, deprecation, or degraded behavior |
| `error` | Operation failed but the application remains usable |
| `critical` | A component or important workflow is unavailable |
| `alert` | Immediate operator action is required |
| `emergency` | Store/system is unusable |

Use the level methods (`debug()`, `info()`, `warning()`, `error()`) or `log()`. `WC_Logger::add()` is legacy and explicitly not the preferred API.

WooCommerce can disable logging globally and can set a minimum severity threshold. In 11.0.0 the default threshold is `none`, meaning all levels are accepted, but site settings or `WC_LOG_THRESHOLD` can change that. Never make application correctness depend on a log entry being handled.

## Structured context

Prefer a constant message plus small, allowlisted context:

```php
$logger->error(
    'Provider capture failed.',
    array(
        'source'             => 'myplugin-gateway',
        'order_id'           => $order->get_id(),
        'provider_reference' => myplugin_mask_reference( $provider_reference ),
        'provider_code'      => sanitize_key( $provider_code ),
        'correlation_id'     => $correlation_id,
    )
);
```

Current file-v2 handling JSON-encodes context other than `source`. WooCommerce 11.0 writes that JSON without adding/removing slashes and preserves unescaped Unicode and URL slashes. Pass ordinary unslashed PHP values; do not call `addslashes()`/`stripslashes()` around logger context. Other handlers may format it differently, so pass serializable scalars/small arrays, not `WC_Order`, HTTP response objects, exceptions, resources, or closures.

Use a request/job correlation ID that is random and non-secret. Carry it across the initial request, Action Scheduler args, provider metadata, and log context where practical. It should help joins without identifying a customer.

## Sensitive-data boundary

Never log:

- passwords, API keys, OAuth secrets, bearer/provider tokens;
- cookies, Cart-Tokens, nonces, webhook signatures, authorization headers;
- PAN/card numbers, CVV, bank credentials, magnetic-stripe data;
- complete provider/webhook/REST request or response bodies;
- full email, phone, postal address, IP address, or unnecessary customer text;
- URLs containing secret or personal query parameters;
- raw SQL containing personal values.

Redact before calling the logger. A later filter is defense in depth, not permission to send secrets into the logging pipeline. Prefer provider error codes and masked references over `$exception->getMessage()` or exception objects because messages/stacks can contain request payloads, credentials, filesystem paths, and PII.

```php
function myplugin_mask_reference( string $value ): string {
    $value = preg_replace( '/[^A-Za-z0-9_-]/', '', $value );
    return strlen( $value ) > 6 ? '...' . substr( $value, -6 ) : '[redacted]';
}
```

## Gateway and webhook example

```php
try {
    $result = $client->capture( $provider_payment_id, $amount );
} catch ( Throwable $error ) {
    wc_get_logger()->error(
        'Capture request failed.',
        array(
            'source'          => 'myplugin-gateway',
            'order_id'        => $order_id,
            'exception_class' => get_class( $error ),
            'correlation_id'  => $correlation_id,
        )
    );

    throw new RuntimeException( 'Provider capture failed.' );
}
```

Do not return log detail to the customer. Customer/admin messages, private order notes, and diagnostic logs have different audiences.

## Volume and hot paths

- Do not log every product, cart calculation, price getter, REST schema call, or session read at `info`.
- Log batch/job start, aggregate result, retry, and final failure; use `debug` for bounded per-item detail.
- Avoid `backtrace => true` except targeted debugging: backtraces cost CPU/memory and expose paths.
- Do not serialize large arrays to context.
- Rate-limit repeated warnings for the same root cause.
- Remove temporary debug logging before release or keep it behind a plugin debug setting disabled by default.

Logging itself can fail because of permissions, disk, database, handler, or global settings. Never let a logging failure replace or mask the primary business exception.

## Retention and handlers

WooCommerce 11.0.0 defaults to file-v2 handling and 30-day retention, but merchants can change logging enabled state, handler, retention, and threshold. Cleanup runs on `woocommerce_cleanup_logs` through `wc_cleanup_logs()`. File-v2 cleanup now scans/deletes expired files in batches of 100, continuing past vetoed files; a retention filter can preserve a file without causing later expired pages to be skipped.

Do not delete or rotate WooCommerce log files directly. Do not assume file paths; the active handler may use database storage or a custom implementation.

To add a handler, filter instances through `woocommerce_register_log_handlers` and implement `WC_Log_Handler_Interface`. Keep the default handler unless replacement is an explicit store policy. A custom remote handler must have strict timeouts/queueing, redaction, bounded retries, and must never block checkout.

`woocommerce_logging_class` replaces the shared logger and affects every WooCommerce extension. Do not use it for a plugin-local transport unless you intentionally own the store-wide logging contract.

## Filtering and suppression

`woocommerce_logger_log_message` runs per handler and returning `null` suppresses that entry for that handler. Global filters can affect unrelated plugins, so scope by `context['source']` and avoid broad message rewriting.

Use suppression only for deliberate redaction/volume policy. Do not hide payment or migration failures to make logs appear clean.

## Logs versus durable state

Store these in an owned model/order metadata, not only logs:

- provider event IDs and idempotency claims;
- migration/schema version and completed steps;
- export/import cursor and completion state;
- external order/payment identifiers;
- retry count when it controls business behavior;
- audit records required by policy.

The log can reference the durable record with an ID.

## Critical rules

- Always use a stable plugin-prefixed source.
- Log allowlisted structured context, not raw objects/payloads.
- Redact before logging and keep PII to the minimum.
- Choose levels semantically; production thresholds may drop low-severity entries.
- Keep logs bounded in hot paths and background loops.
- Never depend on a log as durable state or an idempotency lock.
- Never expose diagnostic messages directly to customers.

- `wc-payment-gateway` for customer-safe gateway/webhook errors.
- `wc-action-scheduler-jobs` for job retries and aggregate logging.
- `wc-order-lifecycle-and-items` for durable order notes/meta versus diagnostics.
