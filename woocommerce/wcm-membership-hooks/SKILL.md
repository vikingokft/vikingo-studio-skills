# WooCommerce Memberships: hook map

Use this when building or reviewing an integration that needs to react to WooCommerce Memberships events. This is a curated decision map, not an exhaustive dump of every hook call in the plugin.

## Misconception this skill corrects

> "Memberships are just posts/meta, so query `wc_user_membership` posts and update `_member_plan_id` or `post_status` directly."

User memberships are stored as custom posts, but the plugin has object wrappers, status hooks, access rules, order-grant metadata, REST/webhook behavior, profile-field storage, and Subscriptions integration. Prefer public functions and `WC_Memberships_User_Membership` methods unless the task explicitly requires low-level inspection.

## When to use this skill

Trigger when ANY of the following is true:

- The user asks for WooCommerce Memberships actions/filters, lifecycle hooks, status hooks, purchase grant hooks, profile fields, REST API hooks, webhooks, member directory, members area, or Subscriptions-linked memberships.
- Code contains `wc_memberships_`, `WC_Memberships_User_Membership`, `WC_Memberships_Membership_Plan`, `wc_user_membership`, `wcm-active`, `_member_plan_id`, `_wc_memberships_access_granted`, or `woocommerce-memberships`.
- You need to decide whether to hook at membership creation, post save, status transition, access grant, profile field save, API response shaping, or frontend members-area rendering.

## Workflow

1. Identify the layer first: user membership lifecycle, purchase/free-signup grant, access/restriction, discount, profile fields, REST/webhook, members area, CSV/admin, or Subscriptions integration.
2. Prefer public functions and objects over raw `WP_Query`, `wp_update_post()`, or direct post meta writes.
3. For status strings, know the boundary: WP post statuses use `wcm-` prefix, but object methods and lifecycle hooks commonly use unprefixed statuses such as `active`, `paused`, `cancelled`, `expired`, `free_trial`, `delayed`.
4. Before implementing, inspect the installed plugin line with:

```bash
rg -n "hook_name|function_name" wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-memberships/src wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-memberships/templates
```

## Storage facts agents must not guess

Memberships registers two CPTs: `wc_membership_plan` for plans and `wc_user_membership` for user memberships. A user membership's plan ID is `post_parent`, and its member/user ID is `post_author`; the installed plugin does not use `_member_plan_id` as the plan relation.

Core plan meta keys are `_access_method`, `_access_length`, `_access_start_date`, `_access_end_date`, `_product_ids`, `_members_area_sections`, and `_email_content`.

Core user membership meta keys are `_start_date`, `_end_date`, `_cancelled_date`, `_paused_date`, `_paused_intervals`, `_product_id`, `_order_id`, `_previous_owners`, `_renewal_login_token`, and `_locked`.

Membership rules are stored in the `wc_memberships_rules` option. Rule type values are `content_restriction`, `product_restriction`, and `purchasing_discount`.

When WooCommerce Subscriptions links a membership, the `wc_user_membership` post gets `_subscription_id`; subscription-linked memberships may also use `_has_installment_plan` and `_free_trial_end_date`.

## Active-detection canon

When gating code that registers something at FluentCRM / WP boot time (FluentCRM trigger / action, WC custom block, JFB action, etc.), use a symbol that exists at FILE LOAD — not one declared inside Memberships's own `plugins_loaded:10` callback. The symptom of getting this wrong is non-deterministic: works on some installs, your code disappears on others, depending on plugin activation order.

```php
// RIGHT — declared at file scope in woocommerce-memberships.php:83.
// Available the moment WP includes the plugin file, before any hook fires.
class_exists('WC_Memberships_Loader');

// WRONG — load-order race.
// wc_memberships() is declared inside class-wc-memberships.php which
// Memberships's plugins_loaded:10 callback require_onces from init_plugin().
// If your registration callback runs BEFORE Memberships's, function_exists
// returns false and your code skips registration silently.
function_exists('wc_memberships');
```

Same rule for `WC_Memberships` itself (the main class): it's loaded INSIDE `init_plugin()` so `class_exists('WC_Memberships')` is also racy. The loader class is the safe top-level checkpoint. At call time (REST endpoints, funnel handlers, AJAX) all classes/functions are loaded — the racy checks only matter at registration time.

## Public API first

| Need | API | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Get one membership | `wc_memberships_get_user_membership( $id, $plan = null )` | Returns `WC_Memberships_User_Membership` or false. Subscriptions integration may return the subscription-aware subclass. |
| Get memberships for user/query | `wc_memberships_get_user_memberships( $user_id, $args )` | Prefer over hand-written membership `WP_Query` unless doing admin/reporting internals. |
| Get active memberships | `wc_memberships_get_user_active_memberships( $user_id, $args )` | Uses Memberships status semantics. |
| Check plan membership | `wc_memberships_is_user_member( $user_id, $plan )` | General membership check. |
| Check active membership | `wc_memberships_is_user_active_member( $user, $plan )` | Use for "currently active member" business rules. |
| Create membership | `wc_memberships_create_user_membership( $args, $action = 'create' )` | Lets Memberships run grant/renew/update logic. Throws `SV_WC_Plugin_Exception` on missing plan — wrap in try/catch. Sets `post_status = 'wcm-active'` by default; override with `$membership->update_status('paused', $note)` after. |
| Get plan(s) | `wc_memberships_get_membership_plan()`, `wc_memberships_get_membership_plans()` | Avoid reading plan post meta directly. |
| Status registry | `wc_memberships_get_user_membership_statuses( $with_labels = true, $prefixed = true )` | Canonical picker / dropdown source. Pass `(true, false)` for `{key, label}` pairs with UNPREFIXED keys (`active` not `wcm-active`) — that's the form `update_status()` accepts. Honours the `wc_memberships_user_membership_statuses` filter so 3rd-party additions appear automatically. |
| Set / clear start date | `$membership->set_start_date( $date_string_or_empty )` | Empty string defaults to `current_time('timestamp', true)` — useful for "member-since = now" semantics. |
| Set / clear end date | `$membership->set_end_date( $timestamp_or_string_or_empty )` | Empty string clears the end date — the canonical "unlimited / never expires" pattern. Numeric timestamp or `strtotime`-able string accepted. |
| Check access | `wc_memberships_user_can( $user_id, 'view'|'purchase', $target, $when = '' )` | Use targets like `array( 'post' => $post_id )` or `array( 'product' => $product_id )`. |

## User membership lifecycle hooks

| Need | Hook | Type | Args | Use |

## Common mistakes

```php
// WRONG: skips Memberships creation/update hooks and object semantics.
wp_insert_post( array(
    'post_type'   => 'wc_user_membership',
    'post_status' => 'wcm-active',
) );

// RIGHT: let Memberships create/renew/update the user membership.
$membership = wc_memberships_create_user_membership( array(
    'user_id' => $user_id,
    'plan_id' => $plan_id,
) );

// WRONG: status meta/post writes bypass object methods and can miss side effects.
wp_update_post( array( 'ID' => $membership_id, 'post_status' => 'wcm-cancelled' ) );

// RIGHT: use the object API; pass unprefixed status.
$membership = wc_memberships_get_user_membership( $membership_id );
if ( $membership instanceof WC_Memberships_User_Membership ) {
    $membership->update_status( 'cancelled', 'Cancelled by external CRM.' );
}

// WRONG: raw "active" check misses Memberships access semantics and delayed/free-trial cases.
$is_member = 'wcm-active' === get_post_status( $membership_id );

// RIGHT: use public checks for business rules.
if ( wc_memberships_is_user_active_member( $user_id, $plan_id ) ) {
    myplugin_enable_feature( $user_id );
}

// WRONG: function_exists() is a load-order race at registration time.
// wc_memberships() is declared inside Memberships's plugins_loaded:10
// callback. If your registrar runs first (also plugins_loaded:10), this
// returns false and your integration silently doesn't register.
add_action( 'plugins_loaded', function () {
    if ( ! function_exists( 'wc_memberships' ) ) {
        return; // racy — sometimes false even when Memberships is active
    }
    register_my_membership_integration();
}, 11 );

// RIGHT: WC_Memberships_Loader is at file scope — race-free.
add_action( 'plugins_loaded', function () {
    if ( ! class_exists( 'WC_Memberships_Loader' ) ) {
        return;
    }
    register_my_membership_integration();
}, 11 );

// WRONG: hardcoding the status list — Memberships allows 3rd parties to add
// their own statuses via the wc_memberships_user_membership_statuses filter.
$statuses = array( 'active', 'paused', 'cancelled', 'expired' );

// RIGHT: read from the registry (UNPREFIXED keys for object methods).
$statuses = wc_memberships_get_user_membership_statuses( true, false );
foreach ( $statuses as $key => $data ) {
    // $key = 'active', 'paused', ...; $data['label'] = 'Active', 'Paused', ...
}
```

## Cross-references

- Use `wcm-data-model-subscriptions-link` for exact CPT names, meta keys, rule storage, profile-field storage, and Memberships-Subscriptions relation details.
- Use `wcm-access-discounts` for access checks, restriction/drip hooks, member discounts, and price-adjustment recursion safety.
- Use `wcs-subscription-hooks` or `wcs-renewal-scheduler` when the membership is tied to WooCommerce Subscriptions renewal/payment flow.
