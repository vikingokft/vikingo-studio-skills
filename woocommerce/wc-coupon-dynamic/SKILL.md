# WooCommerce virtual coupons

WooCommerce calls these **virtual coupons**. “Pseudo coupon” is an informal description, not the core term. Use one when a code is generated or resolved from another authoritative store and creating a `shop_coupon` post per code would cause unnecessary synchronization.

## Choose the right model

| Need | Model |
|---|---|
| Merchant edits the code; core reporting, holds, and usage limits should work | Persisted `WC_Coupon`; use `wc-coupon-types-rules` |
| A namespaced code maps to an external entitlement | Virtual coupon from this skill |
| A new discount formula appears in the coupon type selector | Register a complete custom type with `wc-coupon-types-rules`; it may also be used by a virtual coupon |
| A surcharge or positive adjustment | WooCommerce fee API, not a negative coupon |

A virtual coupon is not automatically safer or faster. Its resolver and usage ledger replace storage and concurrency behavior that core normally supplies.

## Understand the resolution contract

`WC_Coupon::__construct()` filters the unresolved value before database lookup:

```php
$coupon = apply_filters( 'woocommerce_get_shop_coupon_data', false, $data, $this );
```

A truthy result is passed to `read_manual_coupon()`, which sets ID `0`, marks the object virtual, and skips persisted lookup. Returning `false` means “not resolved by this filter” and lets later filters or the database handle the input.

The input may be an integer ID or a string code. Do not type it as `string`. The filter can run on frontend, Store API, REST-adjacent order operations, admin, CLI, cron, and repeated calculation paths.

## Use an owned namespace and one request snapshot

```php
final class MyPlugin_Virtual_Coupons {
	private const PREFIX = 'loyalty-';

	/** @var array<string,object|null> */
	private static $entitlements = array();

	public static function normalize( $input ): ?string {
		if ( ! is_string( $input ) ) {
			return null;
		}

		$code = wc_strtolower( wc_format_coupon_code( $input ) );
		return 0 === strpos( $code, self::PREFIX ) ? $code : null;
	}

	public static function entitlement( string $code ) {
		if ( ! array_key_exists( $code, self::$entitlements ) ) {
			self::$entitlements[ $code ] = myplugin_find_entitlement( $code );
		}

		return self::$entitlements[ $code ];
	}

	public static function resolve( $resolved, $input ) {
		if ( false !== $resolved ) {
			return $resolved; // Preserve a resolver that ran earlier.
		}

		$code = self::normalize( $input );
		if ( null === $code ) {
			return false;
		}

		$entitlement = self::entitlement( $code );

		// Keep every owned-prefix code virtual, including denied/unknown ones.
		// Validation below rejects this inert marker without database fallback.
		if ( ! $entitlement ) {
			return array(
				'discount_type' => 'fixed_cart',
				'amount'        => '0',
				'description'   => __( 'Unavailable virtual coupon', 'myplugin' ),
			);
		}

		return array(
			'discount_type'       => 'percent',
			'amount'              => '10',
			'individual_use'      => true,
			'usage_limit'         => 1,
			'usage_count'         => (int) $entitlement->usage_count,
			'date_expires'        => $entitlement->expires_at,
			'exclude_sale_items'  => true,
			'description'         => __( 'Loyalty discount', 'myplugin' ),
		);
	}
}

add_filter(
	'woocommerce_get_shop_coupon_data',
	array( MyPlugin_Virtual_Coupons::class, 'resolve' ),
	10,
	2
);
```

Claim only a cheap, namespaced prefix before database or HTTP work. A request cache is not merely an optimization: it keeps repeated validation/calculation within one request on the same entitlement snapshot.

### Prevent fallback collisions

If an invalid owned-prefix code returns `false`, Woo may load a persisted coupon with the same normalized code. Choose and enforce one of these policies:

1. prohibit persisted coupons in the reserved namespace; or
2. return an inert virtual marker for every owned-prefix code and reject unknown/unauthorized markers in validation, as above.

Do not return a malformed array. The marker must be a valid, harmless coupon object and must fail closed in the validation layer.

## Validate without side effects

```php
add_filter(
	'woocommerce_coupon_is_valid',
	static function ( bool $valid, WC_Coupon $coupon, WC_Discounts $discounts ): bool {
		$code = MyPlugin_Virtual_Coupons::normalize( $coupon->get_code() );
		if ( null === $code ) {
			return $valid;
		}

		$entitlement = MyPlugin_Virtual_Coupons::entitlement( $code );
		if ( ! $entitlement || ! is_user_logged_in() ) {
			return false;
		}

		return $valid
			&& (int) $entitlement->user_id === get_current_user_id()
			&& myplugin_user_can_redeem( get_current_user_id(), $code );
	},
	10,
	3
);
```

Use `woocommerce_coupon_is_valid_for_product` for per-line eligibility and `woocommerce_coupon_is_valid` for coupon-wide rules. Validation may run repeatedly against a `WC_Cart` or `WC_Order`; keep it deterministic, bounded, and side-effect free. Never consume entitlement during validation or calculation.

Returning `false` gives core's filtered-invalid error. A callback may deliberately throw an `Exception` for a customer-safe custom denial message because `WC_Discounts` catches it, but do not leak whether another user's entitlement exists.

## Supply canonical manual data

`read_manual_coupon()` accepts the same property names used by `WC_Coupon::set_props()`:

| Key | Expected value |
|---|---|
| `discount_type`, `amount` | registered type; decimal-compatible amount |
| `individual_use`, `exclude_sale_items`, `free_shipping` | booleans |
| `product_ids`, `excluded_product_ids` | arrays of product IDs |
| `product_categories`, `excluded_product_categories` | arrays of `product_cat` term IDs |
| `minimum_amount`, `maximum_amount` | decimal-compatible values |
| `usage_limit`, `usage_limit_per_user`, `limit_usage_to_x_items`, `usage_count` | integers |
| `date_expires` | parseable date, timestamp, or `WC_DateTime` |
| `email_restrictions` | array of billing email patterns |
| `description` | string |

Use the canonical `date_expires`; `expiry_date` is only a compatibility alias. Use booleans rather than `'yes'`/`'no'`, and integer arrays rather than comma-separated IDs. Do not call `save()` on an ID-zero virtual coupon; that changes the storage model.

## Own atomic usage accounting

Virtual does not disable all native validation:

- global `usage_limit` is compared with the supplied `usage_count`;
- a filter-resolved virtual object has no coupon data store, so checkout skips native tentative holds and core cannot increment/decrement it;
- native per-user history and tentative checkout holds require a persisted coupon ID, so `usage_limit_per_user` is not sufficient for a virtual coupon;
- there is no core concurrency reservation for an external entitlement.

Use an owned ledger/table with a unique key such as `(order_id, normalized_coupon_code)`. Atomically reserve or consume a slot at one documented lifecycle boundary, record repeated callbacks idempotently, and define cancellation, failed-payment, expiry, and refund reversal policy. Do not implement a counter as `get_option()` followed by `update_option( $count + 1 )`.

If strict single-use protection is required before payment, create an expiring reservation tied to the checkout/order and finalize it after the chosen success event. Release abandoned reservations. Treat resolver `usage_count` as display/validation input, not as the concurrency lock.

## Preserve order snapshots

Normal checkout creates a coupon order item and writes Woo's compact `coupon_info` snapshot. It contains ID, code, type, nominal amount, and optional free-shipping flag. Do not extend that JSON array; store custom immutable facts as separate namespaced coupon-line metadata through `woocommerce_checkout_create_order_coupon_item`.

Historical recalculation may reconstruct an ID-zero/missing coupon from `coupon_info`. Your custom discount-type registration and calculation must still be loaded. If the result depends on mutable external state, snapshot the required rate/tier/rule outcome and restore it through `woocommerce_order_recalculate_coupons_coupon_object` rather than calling today's entitlement service.

### Direct application to an existing order

`WC_Order::apply_coupon()` recalculates item and tax totals, but the direct virtual-object path has a snapshot trap: core later performs an ID lookup and may construct `new WC_Coupon( 0 )`, losing the original virtual type/amount before it stores `coupon_info`.

After a successful direct apply, repair only the matching coupon item's core snapshot with the original object's unmodified `get_short_info()` result, and save custom facts separately:

```php
$result = $order->apply_coupon( $virtual_coupon );

if ( ! is_wp_error( $result ) ) {
	foreach ( $order->get_items( 'coupon' ) as $coupon_item ) {
		if ( wc_is_same_coupon( $coupon_item->get_code(), $virtual_coupon->get_code() ) ) {
			$coupon_item->update_meta_data( 'coupon_info', $virtual_coupon->get_short_info() );
			$coupon_item->update_meta_data( '_myplugin_rule_snapshot', $immutable_snapshot );
			$coupon_item->save();
			break;
		}
	}
}
```

Guard this workaround with a regression test against the supported WooCommerce version; internal order-application behavior can change.

## Support every shopper surface

Cart and Checkout Blocks/Store API still construct server-side `WC_Coupon` and use `WC_Discounts`, so a globally loaded resolver and validation filters work there. Do not limit hooks to classic form requests. Test:

- classic cart and checkout;
- Cart and Checkout Blocks / Store API apply and remove;
- guest and authenticated identity changes;
- repeated totals calculation and checkout retries;
- admin order application and recalculation;
- concurrent last-slot redemption;
- cancellation, failed payment, full/partial refund policy;
- code collision with a persisted coupon;
- custom type plugin deactivation and historical recalculation.

Prefer simple normalized code characters. The Store API's coupon endpoints and older/by-code route patterns do not all accept identical arbitrary characters.
