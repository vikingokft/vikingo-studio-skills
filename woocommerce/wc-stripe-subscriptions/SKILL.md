# Stripe and WooCommerce Subscriptions

Use this for the boundary between Stripe's token/intent model and WCS's subscription, renewal-order, and payment-method-change model. A Woo token alone is not enough: renewals also depend on the subscription gateway and Stripe metadata.

## Runtime contract

Stripe initializes Subscriptions support only when `WC_Subscriptions` and `WC_Subscription` are loaded. The main `stripe` gateway advertises:

- `subscriptions`, cancellation, suspension, reactivation
- amount/date changes
- customer/admin payment-method changes
- multiple subscriptions

It does **not** advertise `gateway_scheduled_payments`. Therefore WCS schedules renewals, creates renewal orders, and dispatches the Stripe gateway hook. Do not create a second Stripe renewal cron.

Stripe 10.9 uses an internal shared hook manager so the main gateway and lazily created Optimized Checkout method do not register the same subscription callbacks twice. Do not instantiate Stripe gateway/payment-method classes merely to obtain their hooks, and do not call the internal hook manager as an extension API. Observe the public Woo/WCS/Stripe hooks instead.

Reusable Stripe sub-gateways may have different IDs and capabilities. Ask the actual gateway object:

```php
$gateway = wc_get_payment_gateway_by_order( $subscription );

if ( $gateway && $subscription->payment_method_supports( 'subscriptions' ) ) {
    // The stored gateway is available for automatic WCS renewals.
}
```

Do not infer support from a `stripe_` prefix alone.

## Automatic renewal flow

1. WCS runs `woocommerce_scheduled_subscription_payment` for the subscription.
2. WCS creates a renewal order and copies the recurring payment context.
3. WCS dispatches `woocommerce_scheduled_subscription_payment_{gateway_id}` with amount and renewal order.
4. Stripe registers `scheduled_subscription_payment()` for each supported Stripe gateway and charges off-session.
5. Success completes the renewal order; WCS records renewal success and reactivates/advances the subscription.
6. Failure follows WCS failure/retry handling; SCA can require customer authentication.

Observe Stripe renewals without replacing the gateway callback:

```php
add_action(
    'woocommerce_subscription_renewal_payment_complete',
    function ( WC_Subscription $subscription, WC_Order $renewal_order ): void {
        if ( 0 !== strpos( $renewal_order->get_payment_method(), 'stripe' ) ) {
            return;
        }

        myplugin_sync_paid_renewal( $subscription, $renewal_order );
    },
    10,
    2
);
```

Do not provision on `woocommerce_scheduled_subscription_payment_stripe`; the charge has not necessarily succeeded there.

## Stripe metadata on subscriptions

Stripe stores provider context on the `WC_Subscription` object, principally:

- `_stripe_customer_id`: Stripe `cus_...` owning the reusable method.
- `_stripe_source_id`: current reusable `pm_...`, legacy `src_...`, or `card_...` identifier.

Treat these as implementation storage, not the write API. Read/write via `WC_Subscription` CRUD and the installed gateway/order-helper methods. Do not use `update_post_meta()` because subscriptions can use HPOS and because a payment-method change must also fire WCS/gateway side effects.

Renewal-order cleanup deliberately removes old Stripe fee/net and PaymentIntent data while retaining the customer/payment method needed for the new charge. Never copy `_stripe_intent_id`, charge IDs, or payment locks from one renewal order to another.

## Change payment method

The customer flow is the WCS change-payment page identified by `change_payment_method=<subscription_id>`. WCS owns authorization, capability checks, form handling, update-all behavior, and gateway-change hooks. Stripe owns Payment Element/SetupIntent confirmation and Stripe metadata.

For a new UPE method:

1. WCS verifies that the customer may edit the subscription payment method.
2. Stripe creates/confirms a SetupIntent for the customer's Stripe customer.
3. Stripe validates the selected type and disallows unsupported/prepaid cases where configured.
4. Stripe creates/updates the Woo token.
5. `WC_Subscriptions_Change_Payment_Gateway::update_payment_method()` changes the WCS gateway and fires its hooks.
6. Stripe writes customer/payment method IDs through its subscription helpers.
7. Redirect/SCA completion performs the update only after confirmation succeeds.

Never implement this as:

```php
// WRONG: no WCS hooks, no SCA, no remote validation.
$subscription->update_meta_data( '_stripe_source_id', $payment_method_id );
$subscription->save();
```

For trusted server code, use the WCS change-payment service as the orchestration model and version-guard calls into Stripe internals. For customer requests, keep WCS's built-in page unless you reproduce nonce, ownership, token/customer matching, SetupIntent, and update-all semantics.

## Express Checkout change-payment support

Stripe 10.8 adds Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Link on the WCS Change payment method page.

- Setting location key: `change_payment_method` inside `express_checkout_button_locations`.
- Availability filter: `wc_stripe_show_express_checkout_on_change_payment_method`.
- Detection still requires a valid WCS subscription, connected account, SSL outside test mode, available `stripe` gateway, and enabled Express Checkout method/location.
- Optimized Checkout remains disabled on this page; Express Checkout is rendered separately before the WCS pay form.
- Stripe links the generated Woo token to the subscription and preserves the wallet title, including after a 3DS redirect.

Do not force the filter to `true` as a substitute for enabling/connecting Stripe; the filter only changes the final location decision.

The Express Checkout flow unsets automatic “update all subscriptions” consent because confirmation occurs before that checkbox is shown. A custom clone must not interpret a hidden/default checkbox as consent.

### Link token contract

Link does not become a separate WCS gateway. Native Stripe `type=link` uses `WC_Payment_Token_Link`; a `type=card` PaymentMethod used through Link remains `WC_Stripe_Payment_Token_CC`. Both use gateway `stripe` and may have a `pm_...` value, while `_stripe_source_id` can point to either shape. Inspect the retrieved PaymentMethod or hydrated token type before using email versus card getters; never classify it from the prefix or write `stripe_link` to the subscription.

Express change-payment replaces the subscription's attached Woo token IDs with the token matching the new PaymentMethod and preserves the Link-facing title, including across redirect authentication. Do not replace this with a raw `_stripe_source_id` update. Use `wc-stripe-link-payments` for Link consent, duplicate-by-email, reconciliation, and token-class details.

## Add method and update all

On My Account Add payment method, Stripe can show “Update the payment method for all of my current subscriptions”. After `woocommerce_stripe_add_payment_method`, it iterates eligible subscriptions and calls `WC_Subscriptions_Change_Payment_Gateway::update_payment_method()` with Stripe payment meta.

Relevant filters include:

- `wc_stripe_display_update_subs_payment_method_card_checkbox`
- `wc_stripe_update_subs_payment_method_card_statuses`
- `wc_stripe_save_to_subs_text`
- `wc_stripe_save_to_subs_checked`

Keep the default unchecked unless the product explicitly requires a well-explained bulk update.

## Failed renewals and SCA

For a customer-paid failed renewal, WCS fires:

```text
woocommerce_subscription_failing_payment_method_updated_{gateway_id}
```

Stripe listens to the exact stored gateway ID, for example `woocommerce_subscription_failing_payment_method_updated_stripe`, and copies the successful renewal order's Stripe customer/payment method back to the subscription.

Since WCS 8.8, same-gateway failed-renewal retries do not fire ordinary `woocommerce_subscription_payment_method_updated*` hooks. Put retry-recovery behavior on the failing-payment hook; keep actual gateway migration behavior on ordinary payment-method-updated hooks.

Stripe handles off-session SCA by leaving the renewal unpaid, sending Stripe-specific authentication email(s), and letting the customer authenticate/pay. Do not mark the subscription active or call `payment_complete()` merely because an intent exists or is `requires_action`.

Stripe 10.7+ detects Radar-blocked renewals and cancels the pending WCS retry so repeated retries do not reproduce the same block. Stripe 10.9 adds a public observer after the renewal order has been marked failed and after the gateway attempts to cancel retry state and write its notes:

```php
add_action(
    'wc_stripe_subscription_renewal_blocked_by_radar',
    static function ( WC_Order $renewal_order, $response, string $reason ): void {
        myplugin_alert_once(
            'stripe-radar-renewal-' . $renewal_order->get_id(),
            $renewal_order->get_id(),
            sanitize_key( $reason )
        );
    },
    10,
    3
);
```

Use it for idempotent alerting or reconciliation handoff, not to retry or mark the renewal paid. The response can contain provider/customer diagnostics; do not serialize it into logs, order notes, REST output, or notifications. Keep the listener non-throwing so it cannot interfere with the gateway's error path.

## Token deletion and detached subscriptions

Deleting a Woo Stripe token triggers Stripe's `woocommerce_payment_token_deleted` listener and remote detach. It does not safely migrate every subscription that used the token. Before a customer-facing delete, detect affected active subscriptions and either block deletion with a replacement workflow or clearly accept detached-subscription remediation.

Stripe includes a detached-subscription admin detector/bulk action. Treat it as recovery tooling, not normal payment-method migration.

## Legacy SEPA

Legacy SEPA subscriptions can use gateway `stripe_sepa` and source IDs. Current PaymentMethods-based SEPA uses `stripe_sepa_debit`. Stripe includes migration/repair code for legacy SEPA tokens. Do not bulk-rewrite gateway IDs or `src_` values without running the installed migration logic and verifying the remote `pm_` mapping.

## Test matrix

Test at minimum:

1. Initial paid subscription and zero-upfront free trial.
2. Successful automatic renewal with the stored Stripe method.
3. Decline, WCS retry, Radar block, the Radar observer firing once per local alert purpose, and SCA-required renewal.
4. Change payment with an existing token and with a new UPE method.
5. 3DS redirect completion and cancellation.
6. Express Checkout change-payment enabled/disabled and update-all consent.
7. Delete/default token with one and multiple active subscriptions.
8. HPOS enabled; verify subscription and renewal metadata through CRUD.
9. Native Link and card-through-Link signup, renewal, standard/Express change-payment, and redirected authentication.
