# WordPress Admin Drag-and-Drop

WP ships a complete jQuery UI drag-and-drop toolkit and the WAI-ARIA helper core itself uses to announce moves. You do not need SortableJS, dnd-kit, or Dragula for an admin UI. The blocker isn't the API — it's that nobody documents **which primitive matches which UX a plugin developer actually wants to build**. This skill is that mapping.

## When to use this skill

Trigger when ANY of the following is true:

- A plugin admin page needs drag-to-reorder for ANY list of items — repeater rows, custom builder cards, rule-priority lists, sortable form fields, custom taxonomy term order, FAQ entries, pricing tiers, notification levels.
- The user wants a palette of available items that get dragged into a drop zone — block-library-like UIs, condition builders, action chains.
- The user wants a kanban-style board, or any "move card between columns" UX.
- The user asks for "menu-style" or "parent/child" drag — nested trees with indentation.
- The user is reaching for an external D&D library for admin UI when WP's bundled primitives would do.
- Code references `jquery-ui-sortable`, `jquery-ui-draggable`, `jquery-ui-droppable`, `jquery-touch-punch`, `connectWith`, `connectToSortable`.

## Proof this is reusable: where core itself runs these primitives

Same three jQuery UI plugins, four wildly different UXes. If your plugin scenario looks like ANY of these, the same toolkit works for you.

| Core surface | Pattern used | What you can build with the same primitive |
|---|---|---|
| Postbox on post edit screens | Flat sortable + connected sortables (between context columns) | Repeater rows, FAQ list, rule list |
| Dashboard widgets | Same postbox engine | Plugin dashboard cards, status panels |
| Pre-Gutenberg widget admin (`Appearance → Widgets`) | Palette → drop zone, with cloned helper | Block library, action library, condition builder |
| Nav menus admin (`Appearance → Menus`) | Hierarchical sortable with depth math | Any tree UI (term reorder with nesting, page tree, file/folder tree) |
| Admin gallery in media | Flat sortable on attachment thumbs | Image carousel order, slider order |

This isn't theoretical — these are stable, production WP features, all built on the **same three handles**: `jquery-ui-sortable`, `jquery-ui-draggable`, `jquery-ui-droppable`.

## What you enqueue
The handles are pre-registered in `wp-includes/script-loader.php`. Declare them as deps:

```php
add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', static function ( string $hook_suffix ): void {
    if ( 'settings_page_myplugin' !== $hook_suffix ) {
        return;
    }
    wp_enqueue_script(
        'myplugin-builder',
        plugins_url( 'assets/builder.js', MYPLUGIN_FILE ),
        array(
            'jquery-ui-sortable',     // pick whichever you actually need
            'jquery-ui-draggable',    // — leave the rest out
            'jquery-ui-droppable',
            'jquery-touch-punch',     // optional: touch device support
            'wp-a11y',                // for wp.a11y.speak()
            'wp-i18n',                // for wp.i18n translations in announcements
            'wp-api-fetch',           // for persisting order via REST
        ),
        MYPLUGIN_VERSION,
        array( 'in_footer' => true )
    );
} );
```

| Handle | Version | When you need it |
|---|---|---|
| `jquery-ui-sortable` | 1.14.2 in WP 7.1 | Any reorderable list |
| `jquery-ui-draggable` | 1.14.2 in WP 7.1 | Palette items / freely-dragged elements |
| `jquery-ui-droppable` | 1.14.2 in WP 7.1 | Drop targets that aren't sortable lists (trash zone, status bucket) |
| `jquery-touch-punch` | n/a | Touch device support for any of the above |
| `wp-a11y` | n/a | `wp.a11y.speak()` for screen reader announcements |

## Decision tree

| You want… | Use |
|---|---|
| Reorder a single list of plugin items | `.sortable()` on the list |
| Move items between multiple lists (kanban, settings columns) | `.sortable({ connectWith })` on each list |
| A library/palette of templates dragged INTO a builder area | Palette: `.draggable({ connectToSortable, helper: 'clone' })`. Target: `.sortable()` |
| A drop target that is NOT a sortable list (delete zone, "send to status X" bucket, favorites) | `.droppable({ accept, drop })` |
| Hierarchical tree with parent/child indentation | `.sortable()` + depth-aware `sort` / `stop` handlers (see Pattern 4) |
| Anything above, on phones/tablets | Add `jquery-touch-punch` as a dep |

## Pattern 1 — flat sortable list

The most common plugin scenario. Repeater rows in a settings page, FAQ items, rule lists, pricing tiers, anything where order matters but there's no hierarchy.

```js
jQuery( function ( $ ) {
    $( '#myplugin-rules' ).sortable( {
        items: '> .rule-row',
        handle: '.rule-handle',
        placeholder: 'rule-placeholder',
        cursor: 'move',
        tolerance: 'pointer',
        forcePlaceholderSize: true,
        update: function () {
            const $list = $( this );
            const order = $( this ).sortable( 'toArray', { attribute: 'data-rule-id' } );
            $list.sortable( 'disable' );
            wp.apiFetch( {
                path: '/myplugin/v1/rules/order',
                method: 'POST',
                data: { order },
            } ).then( () => {
                wp.a11y.speak( wp.i18n.__( 'Order saved.', 'myplugin' ) );
            } ).catch( () => {
                wp.a11y.speak( wp.i18n.__( 'Order was not saved. Reloading.', 'myplugin' ) );
                window.location.reload(); // Restore canonical server order.
            } ).finally( () => $list.sortable( 'enable' ) );
        },
    } );
} );
```

Why `toArray({ attribute: 'data-rule-id' })` instead of DOM `id`: in repeater rows cloned from a template, DOM ids tend to collide. Use `data-*` attributes — that's what production builders do.

For metabox-style flat lists (with collapse + Screen Options), see **`wp-admin-postbox-sortable`** — that's the special-case skill for the postbox-specific chrome.

## Pattern 2 — connected lists (kanban / move between zones)

When you have multiple lists and items can move between them. Plugin use cases: kanban board for membership states, two-column "available / enabled" toggles, status-bucket UIs, multi-tier rule sets where rules can be promoted/demoted.

```js
const $columns = $( '.builder-column' );

$columns.sortable( {
    connectWith: '.builder-column',
    items: '> .builder-card',
    handle: '.card-handle',
    placeholder: 'card-placeholder',
    forcePlaceholderSize: true,
    update: function ( event, ui ) {
        if ( ui.sender ) {
            return; // The sender list also fires update; only persist once.
        }
        const payload = {};
        $columns.each( function () {
            payload[ this.id ] = $( this ).sortable( 'toArray', { attribute: 'data-card-id' } );
        } );
        wp.apiFetch( {
            path: '/myplugin/v1/cards/order',
            method: 'POST',
            data: payload,
        } ).then( () => {
            wp.a11y.speak( wp.i18n.__( 'Board updated.', 'myplugin' ) );
        } ).catch( () => {
            wp.a11y.speak( wp.i18n.__( 'Board was not saved. Reloading.', 'myplugin' ) );
            window.location.reload();
        } );
    },
} );
```

The critical gotcha: a cross-list move fires `update` on **both** the sender and the receiver. Dedupe on `ui.sender` (truthy only on the receiving list), or you'll double-save.

## Pattern 3 — palette + drop zones

When you have a fixed library of items on one side, drop zones on the other. The palette item stays put (it clones); a new item lands in the drop zone. Plugin use cases: block library, action library for a logic builder, available-tags panel, condition builder.

```js
// Draggable owns connectToSortable; the palette remains because helper is a clone.
$paletteItems.draggable( { connectToSortable: '.dropzone', helper: 'clone' } );
$dropzones.sortable( { receive: convertCloneToPersistedItem } );
```

`connectToSortable` belongs to Draggable, and `helper: 'clone'` keeps the source
item. `receive` must persist the new item, replace the temporary clone only on
success, and remove it on failure. The complete async example is in
`reference.md`.

## Pattern 4 — hierarchical / nested (parent + child indentation)

When you need tree behavior with depth indentation that updates *while dragging*. Plugin use cases: hierarchical taxonomy term reorder with nesting, page-tree style site map, file/folder tree, parent/child rule grouping.

The algorithm:

- Depth is rendered as `margin-left: depth * STEP_PX` (or as a `.item-depth-N` class). NOT as nested `<ul>` markup.
- During drag: read the helper's x-offset and clamp not only to
  `[0, MAX_DEPTH]`, but also to the structural limit: at most one level deeper
  than the previous visible row. Account for the dragged subtree so no child
  exceeds `MAX_DEPTH`.
- Children = following siblings whose depth is greater than the dragged item. At drag-start, detach them into a transport element so the placeholder sizes correctly; at drag-stop, re-insert them after the parent and shift their depth classes by the same delta.

When persisting: walk the DOM in order, each item's parent is "the previous item with depth = current depth − 1". Server side this collapses to a flat list with `parent_id` per row.

See `reference.md` for a compact implementation. For a battle-tested implementation, read `wp-admin/js/nav-menu.js:885`; it includes RTL handling, accessibility hooks, and menu-specific bits most plugins don't need.

## Pattern 5 — droppable trash / status bucket

When the target isn't a sortable list — a delete zone, a "send to archive" bucket, a star/favorite area, a "test now" tray.

```js
$( '#trash-zone' ).droppable( {
    accept: '.tree-item, .rule, .placed-item',
    activeClass: 'trash-zone-active',  // while ANY draggable is being dragged
    hoverClass:  'trash-zone-hover',   // while a valid item is over us
    tolerance: 'pointer',
    drop: function ( event, ui ) {
        const id = ui.draggable.data( 'item-id' );
        ui.draggable.addClass( 'is-pending' ).attr( 'aria-disabled', 'true' );
        wp.apiFetch( {
            path: `/myplugin/v1/items/${ id }`,
            method: 'DELETE',
        } ).then( () => {
            ui.draggable.fadeOut( 150, () => ui.draggable.remove() );
            wp.a11y.speak( wp.i18n.__( 'Item deleted.', 'myplugin' ) );
        } ).catch( () => {
            ui.draggable.removeClass( 'is-pending' ).removeAttr( 'aria-disabled' );
            wp.a11y.speak( wp.i18n.__( 'Item could not be deleted.', 'myplugin' ) );
        } );
    },
} );
```

Useful even when you don't need a "trash" — same pattern works for "click-drag a campaign onto a date in a mini-calendar", "drag a user onto a role bucket", "drop a product onto a category preview". Any target that isn't itself a sortable list.

## Persisting order — REST, not admin-ajax

Don't reach for `admin-ajax.php` for new endpoints. Use REST with a real
`permission_callback`, validation plus sanitization (`order` as a positive
integer array), and `wp-api-fetch` on the client. Server-side, verify that the
submitted IDs are the complete allowed set for that user/container: an args
schema cannot detect omitted, foreign, or duplicate business objects.
`wp-api-fetch` attaches `X-WP-Nonce` for the standard cookie-authenticated
WordPress setup when its nonce middleware is configured by core.

## Accessibility — match the postbox keyboard pattern

Pointer-only drag is a WCAG fail. The pattern WP itself ships: a pair of "move up / move down" buttons per item alongside the drag handle, with `wp.a11y.speak()` announcements. Match it.

Use real buttons, not only a draggable handle. The click handler moves the row in the DOM, calls the same persistence routine as drag-drop, and announces with `wp.a11y.speak()`. See `reference.md` for the snippet and `postbox.handleOrder()` in `wp-admin/js/postbox.js:98` for core's pattern.

## Touch support

jQuery UI's drag handlers remain mouse-oriented. For touch devices, add `jquery-touch-punch` as a dep — it patches jQuery UI mouse interactions to also accept touch events. It's registered in core, so declaring it as a dep is enough. Test real touch and keyboard behavior: the old patch is compatibility support, not a modern pointer-events accessibility layer.

WordPress 7.1 updates the bundled jQuery UI components from 1.13.3 to 1.14.2
and sets `jQuery.uiBackCompat = true` before `jquery-ui-core`. The documented
widget APIs used in this skill remain available, but plugin code that reaches
into underscored widget methods, copied internals, DOM-generated class details,
or deprecated `$.ui.plugin` behavior must be regression-tested. Core's
back-compat flag is not a promise that private internals are stable.

## Critical rules

- **Prefer core's jQuery UI handles for conventional PHP-rendered admin UI**.
  Complex pointer/touch interactions or React-rendered surfaces may justify a
  maintained external library; account for its bundle, accessibility, and
  lifecycle costs explicitly.
- **Always provide a keyboard reorder path**. Pointer-only D&D fails WCAG. Postbox-style move-up / move-down buttons + `wp.a11y.speak` is the WP pattern; match it.
- **`update` fires on both the sender and the receiver** during a cross-list move. Dedupe on `ui.sender` or you'll double-save.
- **`receive` runs BEFORE `update` on the receiving list**. Convert palette stubs into real items in `receive`, persist final order in `update`.
- **Don't initialize a sortable on a collection you'll re-render server-side**. After an AJAX HTML swap, call `$container.sortable( 'destroy' )` before re-initializing — otherwise items get duplicate event bindings.
- **Hierarchical depth is geometry, not DOM nesting**. The nav-menu / Pattern 4 approach uses a flat sibling list with depth classes, NOT nested `<ul>` containers. This is what lets items move across parents — there are no nested containers to "leave".
- **Don't track item position in client-side state**. Read from the DOM (`sortable('toArray')`) at persist time. The DOM IS the model.
- **Persist on `update`, not on `change` or `sort`**. `change` / `sort` fire continuously during drag; `update` fires once on drop. AJAX storms are the result of confusing them.

## Common AI mistakes

See `reference.md` for before/after snippets: flat sortable used for trees, `connectToSortable` placed on the wrong primitive, persisting on `change`, missing `wp.a11y.speak()`, and adding new admin-ajax handlers instead of REST routes.

## Cross-references

- See **`wp-admin-postbox-sortable`** for the metabox special case (collapse + Screen Options + the two nonce fields plugins forget).
- See **`wp-plugin-assets-loading`** for the canonical way to declare these jQuery UI handles as deps without globally bloating admin.
- See **`wp-rest-api`** for the order-persistence endpoint shape (permission_callback, args schema, capability checks).

## What this skill does NOT cover

- React / Gutenberg drag-and-drop. Inside the block editor or any React island, `@dnd-kit/core` is the idiomatic choice. jQuery UI doesn't fit there.
- Extending the existing nav-menus admin (the menu builder you see in `Appearance → Menus`). That's a separate topic — `wp_setup_nav_menu_item` filter, `walker_nav_menu_edit`.
- File drag-and-drop into the media library. Media uses `wp-plupload` (HTML5 file drop), which is a different primitive.

## Where to look in core for proof / reference

You don't need to read these to use the patterns above — they're listed for when you want a battle-tested implementation to copy from.

- `wp-admin/js/postbox.js` — flat sortable (init at line 369), keyboard reorder buttons (line 98).
- `wp-admin/js/widgets.js:195` and `:271` — palette + drop-zone pattern.
- `wp-admin/js/nav-menu.js:885` — hierarchical sortable with depth math.
- `wp-includes/script-loader.php` — the `jquery-ui-draggable`, `jquery-ui-droppable`, `jquery-ui-sortable` registrations and bundled version.
- `reference.md` — hierarchical tree snippet, keyboard reorder snippet, and common mistakes.
