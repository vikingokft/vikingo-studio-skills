# WordPress Abilities API

A standardized registry for plugin / theme / core functionality, designed primarily so AI agents and external tools can **discover** what a WordPress site can do and **invoke** those capabilities through a uniform contract. Each Ability has a stable identifier, JSON-Schema-typed inputs and outputs, and a required permission callback. `WP_Ability::execute()` validates input, checks permissions, executes, and validates output.

Pre-Abilities, the same functionality was scattered across `do_action`, `apply_filters`, custom REST routes, public PHP functions, and ad-hoc plugin APIs (each with its own conventions). The Abilities API consolidates that into one machine-readable surface.

This skill is grounded in WordPress 7.1 core behavior. Server-side Abilities shipped in WordPress 6.9; WordPress 7.0 added the client packages and WP AI Client integration. WordPress 7.1 adds unified public exposure metadata, filtered discovery, a complete execution-filter lifecycle, client-safe JSON Schema preparation, REST collection filters/pagination, and schema-aware run-input coercion. Verify version-sensitive behavior against `wp-includes/abilities-api`, the `WP_REST_Abilities_V1_*` controllers, and the abilities script modules.

## When to use this skill

Trigger when ANY of the following is true:

- Scaffolding plugin functionality that AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, custom MCP clients) should be able to discover and invoke.
- Designing an admin tool whose logic should be reachable from BOTH PHP code and the block editor JS without writing two parallel implementations.
- Reviewing a plugin where you see `wp_register_ability`, `wp_get_ability`, `WP_Ability`, the `wp_abilities_api_init` action, or the `@wordpress/abilities` JS package.
- Registering client-side admin operations with `@wordpress/abilities`, or loading server abilities into JS with `@wordpress/core-abilities`.
- Passing abilities to `wp_ai_client_prompt()->using_abilities()` or handling `WP_AI_Client_Ability_Function_Resolver`.
- Deciding whether to expose a feature as a custom REST endpoint vs an Ability.
- Migrating an existing custom REST endpoint to the Abilities API.

## Availability and installation

Three installation paths, depending on WP version:

1. **WordPress 7.0+** - server-side PHP API plus client-side `@wordpress/abilities` and `@wordpress/core-abilities` script modules ship in core. Feature-detect 7.1 additions before using them on 7.0.
2. **WordPress 6.9.x** - server-side PHP API, registry, REST exposure, and core integration ship in core. Feature-detect the JS packages before relying on them.
3. **WordPress < 6.9 - Composer package** for plugins that bundle their own dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer require wordpress/abilities-api
   ```
   Package: <https://packagist.org/packages/wordpress/abilities-api>.
4. **WordPress < 6.9 - feature plugin** for site-wide install: download the latest release ZIP from <https://github.com/WordPress/abilities-api> or install via WP admin.

For JavaScript, prefer script modules and explicit dependencies. Do not assume a `window.wp.abilities` global exists.

## Registering a category (prerequisite)

Every Ability MUST belong to a category. Register categories on the dedicated init action ([Abilities API docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/abilities-api/)):

```php
add_action( 'wp_abilities_api_categories_init', 'myplugin_register_ability_categories' );

function myplugin_register_ability_categories(): void {
    wp_register_ability_category(
        'myplugin-site-information',
        array(
            'label'       => __( 'Site Information', 'myplugin' ),
            'description' => __( 'Abilities that report on site state.', 'myplugin' ),
        )
    );
}
```

If two plugins register the same category slug, the second registration fails with `_doing_it_wrong()` and returns `null`; the first category remains registered. Pick a slug specific enough to avoid collisions (`myplugin-tools`, not `tools`).

## Registering an ability — minimal example

```php
add_action( 'wp_abilities_api_init', 'myplugin_register_abilities' );

function myplugin_register_abilities(): void {
    wp_register_ability(
        'myplugin/site-info',
        array(
            'label'       => __( 'Site Info', 'myplugin' ),
            'description' => __( 'Returns information about this WordPress site.', 'myplugin' ),
            'category'    => 'myplugin-site-information',
            'input_schema'  => array(),
            'output_schema' => array(
                'type'       => 'object',
                'properties' => array(
                    'site_name' => array(
                        'type'        => 'string',
                        'description' => __( 'The name of the site.', 'myplugin' ),
                    ),
                    'php_version' => array(
                        'type'        => 'string',
                        'description' => __( 'PHP version running on the server.', 'myplugin' ),
                    ),
                ),
            ),
            'execute_callback'    => 'myplugin_get_site_info',
            'permission_callback' => static fn () => current_user_can( 'manage_options' ),
            'meta' => array(
                'public' => true,
            ),
        )
    );
}

function myplugin_get_site_info(): array {
    return array(
        'site_name'   => get_bloginfo( 'name' ),
        'php_version' => PHP_VERSION,
    );
}
```

## Registration arguments — what's required

WordPress 6.9+ validates these arguments in `WP_Ability::prepare_properties()` and `WP_Abilities_Registry::register()`:

| Field | Required | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | yes | string | Translated, human-readable. |
| `description` | yes | string | Translated. AI agents read this to decide whether to invoke. |
| `category` | yes | string | Slug must match a registered category. |
| `input_schema` | no | array | Required in practice when the ability accepts input. If omitted/empty and input is provided, execution returns `ability_missing_input_schema`. |
| `output_schema` | no in core, yes in docs/review | array | Core allows omission and then skips output validation. Provide it anyway for contracts, REST discovery, and agents. |
| `execute_callback` | yes | callable | The PHP function that runs. |
| `permission_callback` | yes | callable | Returns `true`, `false`, or `WP_Error`. Enforced by `WP_Ability::execute()` and by REST run permission checks. |
| `meta` | optional | array | Annotations and exposure flags. In 7.1, `public` seeds channel defaults; explicit `show_in_rest` wins for REST. |

The `description` is the most important field for AI consumers — it's what an agent reads to decide whether the Ability is the right tool. Write it the way you'd describe the function to a smart colleague reviewing the API.

Callback arity depends on `input_schema`: if the schema is empty, WordPress calls `execute_callback` and `permission_callback` with no arguments. If the schema is non-empty, WordPress passes the normalized input as the first argument.

## Naming convention

Ability identifier: `namespace/ability-name` (slash-separated, kebab-case on both sides).

- The `namespace` is your plugin slug or a sub-system inside it (`myplugin`, `myplugin-billing`).
- The `ability-name` describes what it does (`get-site-info`, `cancel-subscription`, `summarize-post`).

Pick names a non-developer could read aloud — `myplugin/cancel-subscription` is better than `myplugin/cancel-sub-v2`. Treat the identifier as a public API contract: once an Ability is shipped and an AI agent or external client depends on it, renaming is a breaking change.

Server-side PHP registration accepts exactly two slash-separated segments (`myplugin/do-thing`). The client-side `@wordpress/abilities` registry accepts 2-4 segments, but use the two-segment form for abilities that need to round-trip through PHP, REST, or the WP AI Client.

## Permission callback

Required. Return `true` to allow execution, `false` to deny, or `WP_Error` for a structured REST permission failure. `WP_Ability::execute()` enforces this for direct PHP execution; if the callback returns `WP_Error` there, core logs it via `_doing_it_wrong()` and returns a generic `ability_invalid_permissions` error so the message is not leaked. The REST run endpoint also checks permissions before execution:

```php
'permission_callback' => static function (): bool {
    return current_user_can( 'manage_options' );
},
```

For object-level abilities (operate on a specific post / user / order), pass the object ID through the meta-capability check:

```php
'permission_callback' => static function ( array $input ): bool {
    return current_user_can( 'edit_post', (int) ( $input['post_id'] ?? 0 ) );
},
```

Keep normalization, validation, and permission filters/callbacks cheap, deterministic, and side-effect-free. In the REST run flow, WordPress can normalize, validate, and check permissions before dispatch, then `WP_Ability::execute()` repeats the execution pipeline. Do not put billing, remote calls, writes, or one-shot state in these stages.

## Executing an ability from PHP

```php
$ability = wp_get_ability( 'myplugin/site-info' );
if ( $ability instanceof WP_Ability ) {
    $result = $ability->execute(); // This ability has no input_schema.
}
```

For an ability with a non-empty `input_schema`, pass the matching normalized
input array to `execute( $input )`.

Public lookup helpers:

- `wp_get_ability( string $id ): ?WP_Ability`
- `wp_get_abilities( array $args = array() ): array<string, WP_Ability>`
- `wp_has_ability( string $id ): bool`

For inspection / debugging during development, use `wp shell`:

```
$ wp shell
wp> wp_has_ability( 'myplugin/site-info' );
=> bool(true)
wp> wp_get_ability( 'myplugin/site-info' );
=> object(WP_Ability) ...
```

## REST and JavaScript exposure

On WordPress 7.1, set `meta.public = true` when the operation is intended for
client channels. It defaults `show_in_rest` to true; an explicit
`show_in_rest => false` overrides it. Set only `show_in_rest => true` when REST
exposure is intended but broader public-channel intent is not. Neither flag
grants execution permission.

Core exposes list/get/run routes, enforces the ability permission callback,
selects GET/POST/DELETE from annotations, and prepares schemas with
`wp_prepare_json_schema_for_client()`. List requests support bounded pagination,
category, namespace, and declared meta filters. Public constraints belong in
JSON Schema; PHP callbacks and WordPress-only keywords are removed from client
schemas. Read `reference.md` for route, lifecycle, and filtering details.

Use `@wordpress/core-abilities` to bridge server abilities into JavaScript and
await its exported `ready` promise before immediate execution. Use
`@wordpress/abilities` alone for client-only categories/abilities. Client-side
permission callbacks never replace PHP authorization. Read `reference.md` for
the verified route shapes, module bootstrap, and complete client examples.

## WP AI Client integration

WordPress 7.0+ can expose selected server-side abilities as AI model function declarations:

```php
$result = wp_ai_client_prompt( 'Summarize current site diagnostics.' )
    ->using_abilities( 'core/get-site-info', 'core/get-environment-info' )
    ->generate_text_result();
```

For AI-driven ability execution, instantiate `WP_AI_Client_Ability_Function_Resolver` with an explicit allowlist. Never give a model a blanket list of all abilities; the ability's own `permission_callback` still runs, but the resolver allowlist is the first boundary.

## MCP adapter — bridging to AI agents

The WordPress team maintains a separate **MCP adapter** that can bridge eligible Abilities to the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Exposure is adapter configuration and metadata dependent; do not assume every registered or merely `public` Ability becomes an MCP tool. The ability's permission callback remains mandatory.

Architectural details of the MCP adapter were not included in the Nov 2025 announcement (deferred to a follow-up post). For now, the practical takeaway: registering a clean, well-described Ability also makes it AI-agent-ready without any extra code on your side, IF the site administrator installs the MCP adapter.

## When to use an Ability vs a custom REST route vs a custom hook

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Operation that AI agents / external tools should discover and invoke | **Ability** |
| Typed operation called from your own JS and potentially reusable by tools | Ability |
| Resource CRUD/public headless API with stable HTTP semantics | Custom REST route/controller |
| Internal extension point (other plugins / themes can wire callbacks) | Custom action / filter hook (see `wp-plugin-hooks`) |
| Pure UI rendering with no logic to expose externally | Block / shortcode, NOT an Ability |
| Webhook receiver from a third-party service | Custom REST route — webhooks usually need a fixed URL contract that doesn't fit the Abilities namespace shape |

Choose by contract, not novelty: Ability for a discoverable typed operation,
REST for an HTTP resource/integration contract, and an action/filter for an
in-process extension point.

## Critical rules

- **Register on `wp_abilities_api_init`** for abilities, `wp_abilities_api_categories_init` for categories. Don't register on `init` directly.
- **Categories are prerequisite.** Register categories before abilities.
- **Identifier `namespace/ability-name` is a public contract** — treat it like a versioned API.
- **Always provide a `permission_callback`**; core requires it. Use object-aware capability checks for object-scoped abilities.
- **Provide schemas even when core does not force them.** If the ability accepts input, `input_schema` is required in practice; without it, provided input is rejected. `output_schema` is essential for documentation and agents.
- **Use `meta.public` and channel flags deliberately on 7.1.** `public` seeds `show_in_rest`; explicit `show_in_rest` wins. Exposure never replaces authorization.
- **Use `@wordpress/core-abilities` for server abilities in JS.** Use `@wordpress/abilities` alone only for client-only abilities.
- **Prepare schemas before sending them to non-WordPress clients.** Use `wp_prepare_json_schema_for_client()`; allowing a keyword does not add server validation for it.
- **Treat 7.1 lifecycle filters as trusted policy code.** `wp_pre_execute_ability` bypasses normalization, validation, permission, callback, output validation, and before/after actions when it short-circuits.
- **Allowlist abilities for WP AI Client tool use.** Do not pass all registered abilities to a prompt.
- **Description is the AI's tool selector.** Write it for a reader who doesn't know your plugin.
- **For pre-6.9 sites, use the Composer package or feature plugin.** Don't reimplement the registry yourself.

## Common mistakes

Audit wrong lifecycle hooks, missing categories/schemas/permissions,
unconditional permission on privileged writes, empty descriptions, generic
namespaces, client categories registered after their abilities, and blanket AI
tool allowlists. Corrected examples are in `reference.md`.

## Cross-references

- Run **`wp-rest-api`** when comparing against custom `register_rest_route` patterns. Many existing custom REST endpoints in plugin codebases would be cleaner as Abilities.
- Run **`wp-ai-client`** when abilities are being exposed as AI model tools or chained through prompt workflows.
- Run **`wp-plugin-hooks`** for the case where the right primitive is actually an `apply_filters` extension point inside the plugin, not a publicly invocable Ability.
- Run **`wp-security-audit`** on the `execute_callback` — it's a request-handling endpoint reached through REST and MCP. Sanitize / validate inputs, escape outputs, treat the input as untrusted regardless of the schema.

## What this skill does NOT cover

- The MCP adapter's internal architecture and configuration (deferred to a separate post in the official series).
- Advanced `@wordpress/abilities` store internals beyond registration, querying, execution, and unregistering.
- Multisite-network considerations for Abilities (not addressed in the Nov 2025 announcement; verify before relying on per-site vs network registration semantics).
- WP-CLI command coverage beyond `wp shell` inspection (no dedicated CLI commands documented yet).
- Building a full hook extension layer around abilities. The verified WordPress 7.1 execution lifecycle is summarized in `reference.md`.
